# Advertising behavior — 2026-09-09 source update

## Status

Source implementation only. No compile, lint, app test, build, AdMob Console change or deployment was performed for this update. Documentation and source are included in the user-requested main-branch delivery; the separate splash lifecycle edit is preserved outside this commit. The previously generated APK/AAB do not include these changes. Device layout and native lifecycle behavior remain unverified.

## Native profiles

`advertising.config.json` records separate `test` and `production` values for Android/iOS. `app.config.js` selects one profile and supplies the matching native App IDs and runtime configuration. Runtime configuration must match its declared platform and selected profile, and the local native module must return the same App ID from Android Manifest/iOS Info.plist; missing/mixed configuration stops ad requests rather than selecting another platform or sample ID.

- EAS development/preview: explicit `LEDPOP_AD_PROFILE=test`, official Google demo App IDs and adaptive banner/rewarded units.
- EAS production: explicit `LEDPOP_AD_PROFILE=production`, existing LED POP AdMob IDs only. Production with a test profile fails config generation.
- Local wrapper: production by default; `-AdProfile test` explicitly selects a native test APK. `-IncludeBundle` requires production. No signing identity change. A local Metro serving a test development client also needs LEDPOP_AD_PROFILE=test; a production/test native-JS mismatch stops requests.
- Profile changes are included in native preparation fingerprints and recorded in the source plan/build result. Native output must be regenerated after this update; do not use an older prebuilt native tree with the new JS.
- This configuration check cannot prove the account-side platform ownership, account approval, fill, impressions or Console refresh settings. Verify generated manifests and final artifacts on the next requested build.

## SDK initialization

One shared in-flight initialization serves root rewarded preload and the Settings banner. It makes the initial attempt, retries 3 seconds after failure, then 6 seconds after a second failure, and stops after three failures. A resolved result with no ready adapter is treated as failure; adapter status is logged. Load timers begin only after initialization succeeds, so initialization and placement retry timers do not overlap.

Cancellation/ads ineligibility invalidates callbacks and cancels the shared timer. A terminal initialization failure stays terminal through screen re-entry. The existing rewarded manual retry can start one new bounded initialization/load cycle; it never queues a show. Configuration mismatch is not manually retried.

## Settings banner

Uses SDK 16.5.0 `LARGE_ANCHORED_ADAPTIVE_BANNER` and measured container width. The wrapper has no fixed 60dp height; the SDK's size drives content height. Left/right/bottom Safe Area are owned once by Settings. At usable viewport heights below 480 logical units, the footer is part of the Settings scroll body so it does not consume a fixed band beside the anchored ad. Other sizes retain the anchored footer. Actual phone/tablet/rotation measurements are pending.

Before the first success: at most three app-controlled requests with 3-second/6-second failure retries; stale/duplicate callbacks are ignored. Final failure removes the failed ad view, shows the existing localized unavailable message for 10 seconds, then hides the message. A later Settings mount is a new visible banner placement.

After a successful load: SDK refresh failure leaves the existing ad view mounted. It does not start app retry timers, remount, or display a terminal failure over the existing ad. Further automatic refresh is controlled by the SDK and AdMob Console configuration. No Console settings were changed. The app's three-request limit applies to initial app-controlled loads, not the SDK's own refresh mechanism.

## Rewarded ads and immersive navigation

Preserves the existing current/next slots, 3/6-second load retries, inline modal messages, manual retry only after final load/show failure, and no automatic playback. A ready user action confirms modal removal and crosses one animation frame before requesting presentation. Initialization completion only changes readiness.

Android presentation uses `immersiveModeEnabled=true` and the local `LedPopAdImmersive` Expo module. During the owned ad flow, it hides navigation bars on app/SDK-owned Activity creation/start/resume/post-resume and window focus, and on host dismissal/show failure. A flow token prevents stale cleanup from ending another presentation. Listeners are removed when the flow ends. It does not poll, add fixed presentation delays, hide with overlays, or modify external app windows.

A 15-second show-to-OPENED watchdog stops on OPENED; it does not time the user's viewing/reward duration or retry a show. Pending presentation is cancelled by backgrounding. OPENED + EARNED_REWARD + CLOSED from the same ad remains required for a reward.

The previously observed external `com.android.vending` Google Play Activity navigation bar remains an acknowledged limitation, as approved by the user. Single-frame entry/exit behavior, three-button and gesture navigation still require a real-device recording. No claim of complete navigation-bar suppression is made.

## Web diagnostic isolation

Ordinary web shows an explicit localized unsupported message and cannot grant an ad reward. The native initialization function's web version reports unsupported; it does not fake SDK success.

To explicitly start development-only diagnostics after authorization to run the web app:

```powershell
node scripts/start-web-ad-diagnostics.cjs
```

This sets `EXPO_PUBLIC_WEB_AD_DIAGNOSTICS=1`; both that flag and `__DEV__` are required. The main screen shows a clearly labeled web-only panel. Choose Preparing, Ready/success, Ready/show failure, or Final load failure; then open the reward modal and use a fresh enabled Watch Ad action. Only selected success grants the existing two-hour Pro simulation. No real video or ad impression is implied.

Settings displays a labeled 150px banner reservation in diagnostic mode. The reward expiry uses web page memory only, never the native reward storage key, and is cleared by reload. Web reward clicks do not emit the native WatchAd analytics event. The existing native ProDebugFab shortcut is no longer imported/rendered.

Implementation lives in `.web.ts/.web.tsx` files. The native diagnostic component contains no imports or reward implementation. Metro rejects project-owned `.web` source resolving into Android/iOS and rejects native bundling when the diagnostic flag is enabled. EAS/local native build entrypoints also reject diagnostic configuration. Actual native source-map/artifact exclusion remains a check for the next authorized build; source guards alone are not proof of an already generated artifact.

## Local logs and measurement limits

`utils/adTrace.ts` keeps the most recent 120 records and writes local console diagnostics: timestamp, platform, placement, stage, attempt, dimensions/profile where available, and SDK error code/domain/original message. No diagnostic upload is added.

App-controlled banner requests record their view-request boundary time and completion/error time. SDK automatic refresh exposes completion/failure callbacks but not a request-start callback in this wrapper: its requestedAt/elapsed time are explicitly null, never fabricated. This is not network latency measurement. Next device checks should inspect Settings content scroll area, footer, ad dimensions and Safe Area at portrait/landscape phone/tablet sizes, plus controlled initial/refresh/initialization failure paths.
